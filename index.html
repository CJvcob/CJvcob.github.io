 	    <h2>Unit 2</h2>
 	    <p><img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-9-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="I"/>'ve learned many things in this Unit. I've learned how to put videos on my web page, and how to set it up. I've learned how to make tables and make them organizd on my website. Also, I now know how to make a navigation menu in my coding. I also learned HTML Syntax, Essential Tag, and Common Tags. All in all, I have learned man things that I never knew before.</p>

 	    <ul>
 	    	<li>Learning how to put a video and have a working video on your site.</li>
 	    	<li>Creating lists and tables in HTML</li>
 	    	<li>Creating a navigation menu in HTML coding. </li>
 	    </ul>

	    <h2>Unit 3</h2>
	    <p>	
	    	In this unit I learned many things, from learning how to do CSS to how to make a pseudo class. This unit in particular was very challenging to me, because some of the coding didn't do what I wanted to do and it frustrated me when trying to get it to work. I learned how to apply a box model in my CSS coding and page layout techniques.</p>

	    <ul>
	    	<li>How a pseudo class work.</li>
	    	<li>How to make the word highlight when hovering over it.</li>
	    	<li>Also the box models work in CSS.</li>
	    </ul>	

	    <h2>Unit 4</h2>
	 	<p>
	 		I have learned a lot from this unit. I learned how to create a favicon for my website, creating buttons, making icons and so forth. Learning them was a bit of a struggle and it took quite some time to get the hang of it and making the code work. I also learned how to create a web page banner for my website. The coding was pretty simple and easy to do. Furthermore, I learned how to set background images which was also simple. Another thing was that I did the selection tool practice when cutting out images. </p>	
	 	<ul> 
	 		<li> Learning how to create a favicon </li>
	 		<li> Setting a banner image </li>
	 		<li> Creating thumbnail images for my website </li>
	 	</ul>


        <h2>Unit 5</h2>
	    <p>
	    	In this unit, we learned about JavaScripting. I learned how to make a working clock onto my webpage(s). Also, how to make it updating in real time and in either 12 hour times, or military time. Another thing I learned, was how to use JavaScript to hide and show content. I could show or hide my clock with clicking the button. Another button I did was, "Show Alert" which means if you click it, a message will pop up. You can also customize it.
	    </p>

	    <ul>
	    	<li>How to make a clock work in real time.</li>
	    	<li>How to create a working button that shows a message when clicked.</li>
	    	<li>Another thing I found informative was making a custom video player.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Unit 6</h2>
	    <p>
	    	In this unit I learned that even though my code may look good, theres going to be errors. For example, I had stray codes that doesn't connect to anything and unclosed codes. I also learned how to validate all my coding so there's no errors inside them. Also, I asked people to test my website to see if they can navigate through it. It went well but people had trouble doing so. So I learned that you need to make your website effective so everyone can use it.</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li> Learning how to validate my code.</li>
	    	<li> Conducting a Usability Test.</li>
	    	<li> How validating code is very important.</li>
	    </ul>

        <h2>Unit 7</h2>
	    <p class="temp">This section will include links to my work for this unit, once completed.</p>
