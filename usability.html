 	<h1>Usability Study</h1>
 	<h2>
 		Method: The "victims" was asked to evaluate my portfolio website.
 				Target Audience: My Peers
 		We made a Google Form for my peers to answer questions such as where the information was on the page.
 	</h2>
 	<h2>
 		Results: Most of the "victims" were able to navigate around my website, but at the same time some had a hard time finding the information on the page.
 	</h2>
 	<h2>
 		Discussion: What I've learned was that even though I can navigate through my website easily, it doesn't mean others can too. My website was effective but not effective enough to where everyone has an easy time navigating through my site.
